# Automatically help you change the file extensions
Hello world! This is a very simple python program to help you automatically rename or even attach file extensions to multiple files (in Windows OS)

# Why do you need this program? Let's find out with an example, i.e. my original motivation for having this super simple program
If you are a windows user, have you ever got impressed by their lock screen pictures? I do.

So one day I thought, hmmm... I wish I could download them and use as my backgroud.

Then here came this python program. And I'll explain why in a sec.

Let's do it:
1. First you need to make sure you can view the hidden files in windows file explorer, yeah I know hidden things tend to be "ugly" but I'm gonna show you something beautiful.
2. If you go to C: > Users > [Your User Name] > AppData > Local > Packages > Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy > LocalState > Assets you will find a bunch of "stuff", which are actually pictures.
3. Now run the program and see what those "stuff" really are.
4. Hope this helps you a little bit or simply brings you some beautiful pictures that you always see.

Have a great day!
